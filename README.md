# Water-vs-Fire
* Water vs Fire: It's a 2D Game
We developed this game during the (Global Game Jam 2022) exhibition at the University of Hail in just 3 days
despite the simplicity of the game that we learned a lot during the development process 
* We used the (Unity) engine for development 
* My role in the team: I worked on the Movement of the players and the Shooting and Health bar and animation, using C# language 
* How to play a game:

There are tow players in the game

1- You can play with First Palyer useing the (W,D,A) for moveing, and (S) for shooting

2- You can play with Scanend Palyer useing the "Arrow"(Up, Right, Left) for moveing, and (Down) for shooting
